Hi, my name is Jonas Sävås. Welcome to my portfolio website!
I recently graduated my comined undergraduate and master's studies in computer science at KTH in Stockholm Sweden. My master's studies targetted software engineering with cool courses about distributed systems and scalability, DevOps, and the most fun group projects regarding software engineering where we created a backend for a version of Hearthsone called Firestone in Clojure.

I'm passionate about computers, software engineering, and video games. Here I will talk about my previous and current projects, experience with technologies like Linux, and ramble on about my favorite video games.

Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch!
